This machine learning task involves creating a classification model to create a classifier for detecting whether the mail is spam or not.
It involves the following steps




**Data Collection**
*Source Identification*: Identify and gather datasets containing labeled email data (spam or ham). Common sources include public datasets like the Enron email dataset.


** Data Preprocessing**
Cleaning: Remove any irrelevant or noisy data (e.g., HTML tags, special characters).



**Feature Engineering:** Create additional features if needed (e.g., email length, number of special characters).

**Model Selection**

Algorithm Choice: Select appropriate algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM) suitable for text classification.


** Model Training**

Grid Search: Use Grid Search with Cross-Validation to find the best hyperparameters for your chosen algorithms.


**Model Evaluation**


Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing set.
